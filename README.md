These are drills and tests done while learning to code/ write unit tests (early 2015).

Drills are split into five categories: Strings, Arrays, Loops, Logic, and Conditionals. Each drill is paired with a file in the test
 package. Each test file has at least three unit tests for its corresponding drill.
